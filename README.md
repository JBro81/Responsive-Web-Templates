# About:

Hey, I'm building some front end templates as I teach myself web development, so I thought I would share!  My first ones are using my new favorite thing, Bootstrap.  AFter some research, I am going to start into Vue JS next.  It seems more beginner friendly than React.

Anyhoo, I hope my stuff helps!
