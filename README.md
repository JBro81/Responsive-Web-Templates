# About:

Hey, I'm building some front end templates as I teach myself web development, so I thought I would share!  Github also keeps my scattered brain focused in one place. JAMstack and blockchain tech.  My first ones are Bootstrap, since I am really liking that framework.  AFter some research, I am going to start into Vue JS next.

I hope my stuff helps!
